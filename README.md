# parallel-scan-pattern

A serial and parallelizable version of the scan pattern. For this pattern, you are combining the map and reduce patterns. The map pattern is performing some type of transformation or computation across an entire data collection (i.e. array). An example would be squaring each value in an array. The reduce pattern is considering every element in a data collection which goes to computing a single value. This single value is an accumulating variable. The example given here is a scan pattern in which we are calculating the prefix sum of an array. In this case, there are two algorithms, one plain scan and one recursive scan. The plain simply does the prefix sum in one singular method. The recursive method, however, will start by doing all of the reduces recursively and then performing the scans recursively. The recursion is done through splitting up the array into segmentsizes that are determined by the user. Each segment will be reduced and used to determine the prefix sum of the next element. A parallelizable version of the recursive algorithm is given using an implementation of the fork/join idea. In order to do this, two separate inner classes were created as instances of the instantiated ParallelSScan object. So, the reduces were invoked by the ForkJoinPool and then the scans were invoked by the same ForkJoinPool at a later time.
